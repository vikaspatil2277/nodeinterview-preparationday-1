        <h5>2.when you import a module you have to use exact name used in the export module </h5>
        <h5>3.syntax import {function} from module</h5>
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>7.How do you import any module in Node.js</h2>

    <p>eg. const fs=require("fs")</p>
    <p>To import third party modules you have to first install the module from npm</p>
    <p>eg. npm install express <br>
           const express=require("express") <br>
            const app =express()</p>
